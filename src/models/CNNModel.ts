 * The CNN portion of our hybrid model handles the feature extraction from solar images.
 * It uses convolutional layers to identify spatial patterns in solar imagery that are indicative 
 * of solar activity before passing these features to the LSTM for temporal prediction.
 * 
 * Our CNN architecture:
 * - Takes input of solar images (primarily SDO/AIA 193Ã… and magnetogram data)
 * - Uses multiple convolutional layers with decreasing filter sizes
 * - Uses max pooling to reduce spatial dimensionality
 * - Includes batch normalization for training stability
 * - Outputs feature vectors that represent significant solar features

/**
 * CNN Feature Extraction Process:
 * 
 * 1. Solar images are preprocessed (normalized, resized, enhanced)
 * 2. Images pass through convolutional layers that extract spatial features:
 *    - First layers detect basic features (edges, bright points)
 *    - Middle layers detect composite features (loops, sigmoids)
 *    - Final layers detect complex patterns (active regions, coronal holes)
 * 3. Max pooling reduces dimensionality while preserving important features
 * 4. Flattening converts the 2D feature maps to 1D feature vectors
 * 5. Dense layers reduce dimensionality further to create compact feature representation
 * 6. Output features are fed into the LSTM model for temporal prediction
